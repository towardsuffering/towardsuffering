A leader in data engineering with more than five years of expertise in creating data management technologies. I assist businesses in balancing a defensive-offensive strategy for data management. I create growth-focused solutions that may be used for AI, sophisticated statistical methods, predictive modeling, and technologies that reduce risks and defend against outside threats.

My most recent position at Armstrong Economics required me to balance the defensive-offensive data management approach. I contributed to the daily operation of a single source of truth system that compiles all system logs into a single-page application. I assumed leadership of initiatives involving data science and machine learning, and I created daily reports on data quality, outlier analysis, null analysis, and data modeling, assessment, and deployment.

The defensive-offensive data management method was used in several of my earlier jobs as well. My work at Intrinio was growth-oriented primarily and focused on the categorization accuracy of text written in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). I improved classification accuracy significantly by classifying financial statement line items with great precision using machine learning and natural language processing.

My responsibilities at Wells Fargo included managing risk and compliance processes to defend the company against the Office of Comptroller of Currency's (OCC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) legal threats. The firm was under legal investigation at the time, and it was part of my responsibility to aid in the defense of the business. Within Consumer Financial Services, I saw chances for standardized reporting requirements, which led to the creation of a 15-item checklist method.

So here's what makes me tick: I like picking up new ideas and putting them into practice because they push the boundaries of my preconceived notions. I put my ideas to the test by asking for other people's feedback in order to think beyond the box. I have a wide range of expertise in the financial sector; I have worked in retail banking, fintech, and international capital markets. I was the founder and CEO of Omni Algo Labs, a recently deceased DAO company. My professional goal is to raise service standards so that the world is a better place.

I'm interested in expanding my social and business networks. Contact me at 727-221-2980 or christopher.rotunno@outlook.com to get in touch.
