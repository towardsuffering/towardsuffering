I'm committed to driving innovation and strategic growth for individuals, teams, and organizations. My mantra, "Grounded in Analytics," reflects a dedication to data-driven decision-making processes, ensuring they're accurate, strategic, and informed. From startups and family-owned businesses to major corporate banks, I've navigated various for-profit environments, applying my analytical prowess to:

- Process over 400,000 credit card applications.
- Conduct in-depth analyses of S&P 500 companies.

These experiences have honed my ability to adapt and innovate, managing financial SaaS platforms with analytical acumen and technical agility in:

- Data Analytics
- Web Development
- Cloud & Containerization
- Audio, Streaming & Recording

In roles ranging from Global Capital Markets Analyst to Consumer Lending Analytics Intern, I've not only applied advanced data analytics but also integrated automation and cloud technologies to streamline business processes.
