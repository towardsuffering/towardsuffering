> I am passionate about learning new concepts and applying new workflows that challenge the old mental model. I try to "𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘰𝘹" by seeking to understand other people's truths and trying to make their truths my own. My experience in corporate culture is drawn from getting involved with retail banking, a financial technology startup and a global economic firm. My career objective is to increase service standards in the financial sector by building business applications, workflows, and pipelines that save time and improve quality.
