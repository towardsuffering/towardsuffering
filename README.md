--- 
I am a highly skilled and motivated data engineer with a strong background in software development and data management. With over 8 years of experience in the industry, I have developed a strong foundation in a variety of programming languages, including Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and have a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and database design.

I have a proven track record of successfully designing, building, and maintaining large-scale data pipelines and systems. I excel at working with both structured and unstructured data and have experience with a wide range of tools and technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, and AWS.

I am a team player with strong communication and problem-solving skills and am comfortable working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn, and am excited to bring my skills and expertise to a company that values data-driven decision-making and innovation.

I'm interested in expanding my social and business networks. Contact me at 727-221-2980 or christopher.rotunno@outlook.com to get in touch.
